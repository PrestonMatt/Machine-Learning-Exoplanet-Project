1. kaggle dataset does not provide timestamps. 
	1a does uneven time spacing affect our model? (prob not by much)
	1b what approach did kaggle use to format this data?
		see their github https://github.com/winterdelta/KeplerAI
	ANSWER: we'll probably assume timestamps are roughly evenly spaced and just ignore them, as the Kaggle people did

2. kaggle data is NOT normalized
